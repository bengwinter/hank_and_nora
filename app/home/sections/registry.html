    <p>Nora and Henry will be traveling around the country and living out of a van for the next year. It is their hope to find their new home-to-be in one of the many places they visit as they drive across the United States.</p>
    <p>Their registry will be things that they may need, or would love to have, on their travels. Please, nothing larger than a van.</p>
    <p>Help them fund their trip at: <a href="http://www.honeyfund/noraandhenry" target="_blank">www.honeyfund/noraandhenry</a></p>
