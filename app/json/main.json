Registry

Nora and Henry will be traveling around the country and living out of a van for the next year. It is their hope to find their new home-to-be in one of the many places they visit as they drive across the United States.

Their registry will be things that they may need, or would love to have, on their travels. Please, nothing larger than a van.

Help them fund their trip at: www.honeyfund/noraandhenry
